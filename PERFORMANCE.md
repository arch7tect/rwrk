| 128     | 5,936               | Diminishing returns |

**Optimal**: 64 threads (4x CPU count)

### Final Comparison (Optimal Settings)

| Tool | Throughput | Transfer/sec | Workers/Threads | Architecture |
|------|-----------|--------------|-----------------|--------------|
| **rwrk** | **7,077 req/sec** | 10.01 MB/sec | 1024 async workers | Rust + Tokio + Hyper |
| wrk | 5,905 req/sec | 9.61 MB/sec | 64 OS threads | C + epoll/kqueue |

**Performance Gain: +19.8%**

## Optimization Journey

### Initial State
- Using reqwest (high-level HTTP client)
- Default workers: num_cpus * 4 = 64
- Initial performance: ~850 req/sec

### Optimization 1: Remove Timeout Lag
**Problem**: Workers checked cancellation every 100 requests
**Solution**: Check cancellation on every iteration
**Impact**: Reduced timeout overshoot from 36.97s to 30.08s

### Optimization 2: Switch to Hyper
**Problem**: reqwest adds overhead with higher-level abstractions
**Solution**: Replace reqwest with hyper (low-level HTTP client)
**Impact**: Performance increased from 5,835 to 6,048 req/sec (+3.6%)

### Optimization 3: Remove Header Counting
**Problem**: Iterating headers on every request was expensive
**Solution**: Count only response body bytes
**Impact**: Performance increased from 5,842 to 6,094 req/sec (+4.3%)

### Optimization 4: Increase Worker Count
**Problem**: Default 512 workers underutilized async runtime
**Solution**: Increase to num_cpus * 64 = 1024 workers
**Impact**: Performance increased from 6,094 to 7,077 req/sec (+16.1%)

**Total Performance Improvement: 8.3x from initial baseline**

## Key Findings

### 1. Async Scales Better Than Threads
- rwrk performs optimally at 1024 async workers
- wrk performs optimally at 64 OS threads
- Async tasks have much lower overhead than OS threads
- This allows rwrk to maintain higher concurrency without context-switching penalties

### 2. Low-Level HTTP Matters
- Hyper (low-level) outperforms reqwest (high-level) by ~4%
- Direct protocol handling reduces abstraction overhead
- Critical for maximum performance in benchmarking tools

### 3. Measurement Overhead is Real
- Counting HTTP headers on every request reduced performance by 4%
- Simple body-only measurement maintains peak throughput
- wrk counts all bytes from socket; rwrk counts body bytes only

### 4. Sweet Spot for Concurrency
- rwrk: 64x CPU count (1024 workers)
- wrk: 4x CPU count (64 threads)
- Both show performance degradation beyond optimal point

## Architecture Advantages

### rwrk (Rust + Async)
**Strengths:**
- Memory safety without garbage collection
- Zero-cost abstractions
- Fearless concurrency
- Modern async/await syntax
- Easy to extend and maintain
- Type-safe error handling

**Trade-offs:**
- Slightly larger binary size
- Longer compile times
- Learning curve for async Rust

### wrk (C + Threads)
**Strengths:**
- Minimal overhead
- Mature and battle-tested
- Lua scripting support
- Small binary size

**Trade-offs:**
- Manual memory management
- Potential for undefined behavior
- Thread-based concurrency limits scalability
- Harder to maintain and extend safely

## Conclusions

1. **Async Rust can outperform C** for I/O-bound workloads when properly optimized

2. **Concurrency model matters**: Async tasks scale better than OS threads for network I/O

3. **Safety without compromise**: rwrk achieves superior performance while guaranteeing memory and thread safety

4. **Optimal configuration is key**:
   - rwrk: 64x CPU cores for async workers
   - wrk: 4x CPU cores for OS threads

5. **Modern tooling wins**: Rust's async ecosystem (Tokio + Hyper) provides the performance of C with the safety of high-level languages

## Future Improvements

- Implement custom AsyncRead/AsyncWrite wrappers for accurate socket-level byte counting
- Add HTTP/2 support with adaptive protocol selection
- Implement connection reuse metrics
- Add latency percentile tracking
- Support for custom request headers and bodies
- Lua scripting compatibility layer

## Test Reproducibility

```bash
# rwrk (optimal)
cargo build --release
./target/release/rwrk -u https://exposeme.org/ -t 30

# wrk (optimal)
wrk -t64 -c512 -d30s https://exposeme.org/
```

**Note**: Performance may vary based on network conditions, target server capacity, and system load.
